            <br/>
            I'm brand new to web development and excited about the opportunities that come with this skillset. Before 
            transitioning into the GoForCode program, my expertise focused in process improvement and project leadership.
        </p>
       <h2>Experiences</h2>
        <p>
            My formal education to date has been in Healthcare Management & Policy, as well
            as Data Analytics, both through the University of New Hampshire. Professionally, I've worked
            in the insurance, healthcare, public health, and service industries. Also, as we're preparing for
            buying a house, I started a side-business, where my husband and I enjoy caring for 
            clients' homes and pets when they are away. 
        </p>
        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>
            Exercise, understanding how things work, woodworking, and reading. Also, 
            learning to code.
