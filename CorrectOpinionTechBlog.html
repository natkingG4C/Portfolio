        <div id="intro">
                        There are <em>good</em> ways and <em>bad</em> ways to write a JavaScript for loop. Lucky for you, I know the good ways.

            Consider this quote from Edsger Dijkstra:
        </div>

        <div id="dijkstra">

            <blockquote>"There are very different programming styles. I tend to see them as Mozart versus Beethoven. When Mozart started to write,
            the composition was finished. He wrote the manuscript and it was 'aus einem Guss' (from one cast). In beautiful
            handwriting, too. Beethoven was a doubter and a struggler who started writing before he finished the composition
            and then glued corrections onto the page. In one place he did this nine times. When they peeled them, the last
            version proved identical to the first one." - Edsger W. Dijkstra</blockquote>
        </div>

        <div id="bold-claims">
            I may be the only programmer who takes the good from both <strong>Mozart</strong> and <strong>Beethoven</strong> and discards the bad. I'm that good.
        </div>

        <div>
            Behold:
        </div>

        <pre id="code">
            <code>for(var i = 0; i < 256; i++) { 
                console.log( "The index is: ", i); 
            }</code>     
        </pre>
    </div>
</body>
